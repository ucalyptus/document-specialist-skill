## 7.1 From Static Manuals to Dynamic Knowledge Bases

### Old Model
100-page PDF user manual that:
- Gets outdated immediately
- Is hard to search
- Covers features users don't need
- Requires downloading and reading linearly

### New Model
Dynamic, searchable Knowledge Base (KB) or Help Center that:
- Updates with every product release
- Users can search and find answers in seconds
- Covers user goals, not just features
- Integrates with the product (contextual help)

### Key Features of Modern Knowledge Bases

**1. Prominent Search**
- Users "Google" their problem
- Search should be on every page
- Use autocomplete suggestions
- Track searches with no results (content gaps)

**2. Logical Categories**
- Grouped by user goals, not features
- Examples:
  - ✅ "Getting Started"
  - ✅ "Managing Tasks"
  - ✅ "Collaborating with Teams"
  - ❌ "Settings Menu"

**3. Multimedia**
- Screenshots with annotations (red boxes, arrows)
- Animated GIFs for workflows
- Short screen-capture videos (<2 minutes)
- Interactive demos

**4. Feedback Loops**
- "Was this helpful? [Yes] [No]" on every article
- Track which articles get negative feedback
- Allow users to suggest improvements

**5. Analytics**
- What are users searching for?
- Which articles get the most views?
- Where do users drop off?
- What searches return no results?

**6. Contextual Support**
- In-app help widgets
- Tooltips and inline help
- "Learn more" links to KB articles
- Chatbot for common questions
