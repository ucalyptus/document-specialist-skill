# Greenfield Documentation Workflow

---
TOKEN_BUDGET: 1500
TIER: 3
LOAD_TRIGGER: Intent = CREATE_NEW (template-based documentation)
DEPENDENCIES: skill.md, templates/markdown/*
---

## Overview

This workflow guides the creation of professional software documentation from templates for new projects (greenfield). Use this when the user wants to create documentation without existing code to reverse-engineer.

**Supported Document Types:**
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Software Design Document (SDD)
- arc42 Architecture Documentation
- OpenAPI/REST API Specification
- User Guides and KB Articles
- Deployment Documentation

**Token Budget**: This workflow consumes ~1,500 tokens. Load only when intent is CREATE_NEW.

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Identify Document Type

Based on user request, classify the document type:

| Keywords in Request | Document Type | Template |
|---------------------|---------------|----------|
| "SRS", "requirements specification", "formal requirements" | SRS | templates/markdown/requirements-srs.md |
| "PRD", "product requirements", "feature doc", "agile" | PRD | templates/markdown/requirements-prd.md |
| "SDD", "design document", "technical design" | SDD | templates/markdown/design-sdd.md |
| "arc42", "architecture document", "system design" | arc42 | templates/markdown/design-arc42.md |
| "OpenAPI", "API spec", "REST API", "API documentation" | OpenAPI | templates/markdown/api-openapi.yaml |
| "user guide", "end-user documentation", "manual" | User Guide | templates/markdown/user-guide.md |
| "KB article", "knowledge base", "support doc" | KB Article | templates/markdown/kb-article.md |
| "deployment", "DevOps", "infrastructure docs" | Deployment | templates/markdown/deployment-guide.md |

### Step 2: Load Template and Reference Guide

**For SRS:**
- Template: `templates/markdown/requirements-srs.md`
- Reference: `reference/02-requirements.md`
- Best Practices: `reference/01-philosophy.md`

**For PRD:**
- Template: `templates/markdown/requirements-prd.md`
- Reference: `reference/02-requirements.md`
- Agile Guidance: `reference/08-agile-process.md`

**For OpenAPI:**
- Template: `templates/markdown/api-openapi.yaml`
- Reference: `reference/05-api-docs.md`

**For arc42:**
- Template: `templates/markdown/design-arc42.md`
- Reference: `reference/03-design.md`

**For User Guide:**
- Template: `templates/markdown/user-guide.md`
- Reference: `reference/07-user-docs.md`

**IMPORTANT**: Load ONLY the template and reference guide needed. Do NOT load all templates.

### Step 3: Customize Template

Extract key information from user's request:

1. **Project/Feature Name**: What is being documented?
2. **Domain/Industry**: Healthcare, finance, e-commerce, etc.?
3. **Key Requirements**: What did the user mention explicitly?
4. **Constraints**: Compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS), performance, security?
5. **Stakeholders**: Who will read this documentation?
6. **Target Audience**: Developers, users, executives, auditors?

**Customization Process:**

1. Replace all `[Placeholder]` markers in the template with actual content
2. Use Given-When-Then format for acceptance criteria (SRS/PRD)
3. Include specific examples relevant to the project domain
4. Add compliance requirements if mentioned (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC 2)
5. Customize section depth based on project complexity

**Example Customization:**

**Generic Template:**
```markdown
## 3.1 User Authentication
**FR-AUTH-001**: The system shall authenticate users.
```

**Customized for Healthcare:**
```markdown
## 3.1 User Authentication (HIPAA-Compliant)
**FR-AUTH-001**: HIPAA-Compliant Multi-Factor Authentication

**Description**: The system shall authenticate healthcare professionals using multi-factor authentication (MFA) with audit logging to comply with HIPAA security requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** a healthcare professional with valid credentials
- **When** they attempt to log in
- **Then** the system shall require both password and one-time passcode (OTP)
- **And** the system shall log all authentication attempts with timestamps and user IDs
- **And** failed login attempts shall be locked after 3 consecutive failures
- **And** all authentication events shall be stored in HIPAA-compliant audit logs for 7 years
```

### Step 4: Generate Content

Follow these guidelines for each document type:

#### SRS Generation

     - Summary and description
     - operationId
     - Parameters (path, query, header)
     - Request body (if applicable)
     - Responses (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500)
     - Security requirements

6. **Examples**

**Total**: Aim for 500-1000 lines for comprehensive API with 10-20 endpoints

### Step 5: Add Visual Elements (Offer Diagram Generation)

After generating the document, offer to create diagrams:

**For SRS/SDD/arc42:**
```
I've created the [document type]. Would you like me to generate any of these diagrams?
- System Context diagram (C4 - via mermaid-architect)
- Container diagram (C4 - via mermaid-architect)
- Component diagram (PlantUML - via plantuml)
- Deployment diagram (PlantUML - via plantuml)
```

**For PRD:**
```
I've created the PRD. Would you like me to generate any of these diagrams?
- User journey flowchart (Mermaid - via mermaid-architect)
- State machine diagram (PlantUML - via plantuml)
- Activity diagram (PlantUML - via plantuml)
```

**For OpenAPI:**
```
I've created the OpenAPI specification. Would you like me to:
- Generate a human-readable API reference guide?
- Create sequence diagrams for key API flows?
```

**If user confirms**, invoke the appropriate skill:
- `mermaid-architect` for C4 diagrams, flowcharts
- `plantuml` for UML diagrams, ER diagrams, state machines

### Step 6: Professional Formatting

Ensure the generated document includes:

- ✅ **Front Matter**
  - Title
  - Version number
  - Date
  - Author
  - Status (Draft, In Review, Approved)

- ✅ **Table of Contents** (for documents > 3 pages)
  - Auto-generate with proper heading hierarchy

- ✅ **Consistent Formatting**
  - Heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
  - Numbered sections for formal docs (SRS, SDD)
  - Bullet points for lists
  - Tables for structured data
  - Code blocks for examples

- ✅ **Traceability**
  - Unique IDs for requirements (FR-XXX-001)
  - Unique IDs for non-functional requirements (NFR-XXX-001)
  - Cross-references between sections

- ✅ **Glossary**
  - Define all technical terms
  - Define all acronyms

- ✅ **Professional Styling**
  - Clear section headers
  - Consistent spacing
  - Proper markdown syntax

### Step 7: Save and Offer Post-Processing

**Save to appropriate location:**

```
docs/
├── requirements/
│   ├── [project]-srs.md
│   └── [project]-prd.md
├── design/
│   ├── [project]-sdd.md
│   └── [project]-arc42.md
├── api/
│   └── [project]-openapi.yaml
└── user/
    ├── [project]-user-guide.md
    └── [project]-kb-article.md
```

**Offer post-processing options:**

```
I've created [document name] at [file path].

Would you like me to:
1. Convert this to Word format (DOCX)?
2. Generate a PDF version?
3. Create any diagrams?
4. Review the document for completeness?
5. Generate additional related documentation?
```
